<h1>EC predict the score game</h1>
<h2>1. What the hell?</h2>
This page is doing the administration for a predict-the-score game of some friends (and friends' friends, of course). Players try to guess the scores of the matches of the UEFA Euro 2008, and collect points based on how good they are at it.
<br>
<h2>2. How?</h2>
The exact score of every match is to be predicted, by choosing the appropriate numbers from the drop-down lists. The bet is evaluated based on the score of the game AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND HALF (90 mins). In certain scenarios when a non-draw score is required to decide which team qualifies, then, if the player bets on a tie, the team to qualify (after extra time, penalty shootout etc.) has to be predicted separately. See also the <a href="http://www.uefa.com/newsfiles/19079.pdf">official regulations of the UEFA Euro 2008 (PDF)</a>.

<h2>3. Who wins?</h2>
Well, hopefully all participants. A bit more precisely, who gathers the most points. By every bet, points can be won the following way (home team is the team listed first in a match listing):
<ul>
<li>Predicting Win-Draw-Loss correctly: 2 points.</li>
<li>Guessing the score of the home team correctly: 1 point. (In case the home team scores at least 4 goals in a game, then 1 point is awarded to players predicting at least 4 home goals.)</li>
<li>Guessing the score of the visitor team correctly: 1 point. (In case the visitor team scores at least 4 goals in a game, then 1 point is awarded to players predicting at least 4 visitor goals.)</li>
<li>Bonus:<br>
After every round (group stage, 1/4 finals, 1/2 finals, final) there is on average 1 more point per game to be won based on the following principles:
<br>
For every pair of teams which directly competed aganst each other (were in the same group, or played a knock-out game, respectively) 1 point is awarded to the player if in the rankings based on his/her predictions (in the knock-out stage, there are two possible rank orderings, in te group stage it is 4!=24), the two teams finish in the order as they do based on the results of the UEFA Euro 2008. To see how orders are determined, please consult the official regulations (PDF).
</li></ul>
<h2>4. Disclaimer</h2>
Please don't cheat! We would only like to play a good game, and we prefer to do this against people with similar preferences.
<br>
To avoid strategic betting made in order to preserve one's advantage at later stages of the game, a player cannot watch other players' bets until they finalize it. Except, of course, for the case when more people collude in order to get around this but then they should not have signed up in the first place. Finalizing bets can be done by checking the box adjacent to the drop-downs where one selects the score guessed.
<br>
<h2>5. Participation</h2>
...is based on invitation. The system sends the invitationin email, so an email address is in fact needed to play.

<h2>6. Deadlines</h2>
There are several "betting units" of the tournament:
<ul>
</li><li> 8 group-stage games
</li><li>second 8 group-stage games
</li><li>third 8 group-stage games
</li><li>quarterfinals
</li><li>semifinals
</li><li>final</li>
</ul>
Predictions concerning games of a betting unit can be made prior to 12pm on the day of the first game in the unit. This deadline may change, though - the current deadlines are always posted on the "My Bets" page.
